## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for type safety
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Follow the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Use PascalCase for component files and interfaces (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `ButtonProps`)
  - Use camelCase for utility functions, hooks, and variables
- **Imports**: Group and order imports consistently
  - React imports first
  - External libraries next
  - Internal modules last
  - Sort alphabetically within each group

### Component Guidelines

1. **Accessibility**
   - Follow WAI-ARIA practices
   - Ensure keyboard navigation
   - Use proper ARIA attributes

2. **Responsiveness**
   - All components must work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Use responsive design patterns

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize renders with React.memo when appropriate
   - Be mindful of expensive calculations
   - Consider lazy loading for large components

4. **Props**
   - Define clear prop interfaces with TypeScript
   - Use sensible defaults
   - Provide comprehensive prop documentation

5. **State Management**
   - Keep state as local as possible
   - Use context for truly global state
   - Consider custom hooks for complex state logic

### Testing Guidelines

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write tests for all components and utilities
   - Test both normal usage and edge cases
   - Focus on behavior, not implementation details

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test component interactions
   - Ensure accessibility in integration tests

3. **Visual Regression Tests**
   - Use tools like Storybook and Chromatic

### Documentation Guidelines

1. **Component Documentation**
   - Description
   - Props API
   - Usage examples
   - Accessibility considerations
   - Edge cases

2. **Code Comments**
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - JSDoc for exported functions and interfaces

3. **README Updates**
   - Update README.md when adding new features
   - Keep installation instructions current

### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

- **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `revert`
- **Scope**: Component or file affected (e.g., `button`, `dropdown`)
- **Subject**: Short description in present tense, not capitalized, no period at end
- **Body**: More detailed explanation if needed
- **Footer**: Reference issues being closed, breaking changes

Example:
```
feat(button): add loading state

Add a loading spinner option to the Button component that shows when isLoading prop is true.

Closes #42
```
